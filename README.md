# NLP Assistant with Langchain

## Introduction
This project is an NLP Assistant built using the Langchain framework, which integrates multiple large language models (LLMs) to provide answers about world leaders, generate travel recommendations, and create synonyms for words. The assistant demonstrates how to effectively use prompt templates, sequential chains, and custom output parsers to enhance user interactions.
